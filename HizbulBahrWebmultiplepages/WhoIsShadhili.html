                <h3> Imam Abul' Hasan al-Shadhili was a scholar, spiritual guide, Sufi saint from Tangiers, North Morroco, 
                    who had initiated the Shadhili school of Sufism in the 13th century, making it one of ealier Sufi traditions in North Africa.
                     He was born in 1196 AD in a royal family who had descended both from the Hashimi tribe and the Amazigh Ghumarah tribe. Al-Shadhili
                    spent much of his youth in company of scholars and saints, as well as studying in The Qarawiyyin University, and in devotion to the Sufi Path. 
                    He had travelled to Alexandria to further his studies and spiritual striving. 

                    <br><br>
            
                In finding a spiritual guide, he had travelled as far as Iraq, and upon finding a company of ascetics, he was told that his spiritual guide
                had been waiting for him in his hometown of Tangiers. Upon returning he had met his true Sufi master, Moulay Abdessalam ibn Mashish (d.1227), who had taken
                the spiritual path from a line of teachers going back to the Iraqi Sufi guide, Sayyid Shaykh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani (d.1166 CE). He first met him upon entering
            a mountain named Jabal Alam, where Shaykh Abdessalam is now buried. Upon this meeting, The Shaykh had asked al-Shadhili to purify himself, which he assumed meant
            walking back down and doing the ritual wash. Upon returning, the Shaykh said he didn't purify himself properly, and ordered him to go back and do it properly. This happened a number
            of times before understanding what his guide really meant. Once he returned, he was ordered to take the clothes of his servant, and replaced his fine robes
            with the servant's clothes. The Shaykh then said to Al-Shadhili, "now you are ready", establishing one of the key aspects of The Path:
            stripping away from the temporary world.

            <br><br>
        
            Imam Al-Shadhili had gained many disciples overtime, and passed the path onto one of them, Shaykh Abul' Abbas Al-Mursi(d. 1288). He intiated his zawiyah (monastery) in Tunisia, and had composed
            several devotional prayers and invocations, which is read to this day amongst all initiates of this path, including the prayer presented here, the Hizb al-Bahr. His school had spread all over North
            Africa, and over time had become popular amongst Sunni communities all over The Levant, mainly in Syria. In 1258, on the way to Makkah for the Pilgrimage, Al-Shadhili fell ill in 
            Humaithara, Egypt, and passed away. His tomb is present there and is visited by many.
