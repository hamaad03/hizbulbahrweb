          <h3>The Litany of the Sea, known in Arabic as Al Hizb Al Bahr, is a prayer famous in the Sufi tradition, particularly within the Shadhili Order. 
               It is believed to have been given to the founder of the order, Imam Abul Hassan Al Shadhili,
               by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم when having a vision of him. The litany is composed of verses of the Qur'an, 
               prayers from authentic hadiths, and other supplications. This prayer is found in all Sufi orders, 
               mainly the Shadhilis, Naqshbandis, Ba'Alawis, Qadiris, Chishtis, and has had a general acceptance amongst the Sufis.

          <h2>Origins of the Litany</h2>
          <hr>
          <h3>Muhammad Ibn Abi Al-Qasim Ibn al-Sabbagh in Durrat al-Asrar wa Tuhfat al-Abrar relates how Hizbul Bahr came into existence:
              "The righteous Shaykh Abu al-Aza’im Madi ibn Sultan (may Allah have mercy on him) told us in the city of Tunis (may Allah watch over it),
               as did the righteous and blessed Shaykh Sharaf al-Din, the Shaykh’s son, in the city of Damanhur al-Wahsh in Egypt, in the year 715 AH: 
               The Shaykh [Abul Hasan al-Shadhili] decided to set out from Cairo to perform the pilgrimage, a little while after the main pilgrimage party had set out. 
               He said, ‘I have been commanded to perform the pilgrimage this year, so find me a vessel on the Nile to take me across Upper Egypt.’ They searched for a vessel and 
               found only a ship belonging to Christians on which was an elderly Christian man and his sons. He said, ‘We shall board it.’ So we boarded it and set out from Cairo.
               After two or three days the wind changed so that it was blowing against us, so we made berth on the Nile shore in an uninhabited place. We remained there for around a week, 
               the hills of Cairo still within our sights. One of the pilgrims with us said, ‘How could the Shaykh say he was commanded to perform the pilgrimage this year, when it is already too late?
               <br><br>
                When is this journey going to end?’The Shaykh slept through the middle of the day, and then rose and recited this Litany. Then he asked for the captain of the ship, and asked him his name. 
                He said his name was Mismar. The Shaykh said, ‘O blessed Mismar, unfurl the sails.’ He said, Are we going back to Cairo, sir?’ He replied, ‘We are continuing on our way, Allah willing.’ The captain said, 
                ‘This wind will only bear us back to Cairo before the day is out, and in any case is too strong to sail in.’ The Shaykh said, ‘Unfurl the sails with the blessing of Allah.’
              So we opened the sails, and Allah commanded the wind to change, and the sails were filled so suddenly that the crew had no time to untie the rope from the stake and had to chop it off instead;
               and we set off with a goodly wind. The captain and his brother announced that they had embraced Islam. Their father began to weep, saying, ‘I have lost my sons on this voyage!’ The Shaykh said to him, ‘Nay, you have gained them.’
              That night, the elderly Christian man dreamed it was the Day of Resurrection. He saw Paradise and Hell, and saw the Shaykh leading a great throng into Paradise, his sons among them. He wanted to follow them, but was not allowed to do so,
               and a voice said to him, ‘You are not one of them until you enter their religion.’ He told the Shaykh about this dream and embraced Islam. The Shaykh said to him, ‘The people you saw with me are my followers until the Day of Resurrection.’
              We travelled on, and the journey was made easy for us by many events which would be long in the telling, and all of us performed the pilgrimage that year. 
              <br><br>
              Sidi Madi (may Allah have mercy on him) added: The elderly Christian man became a great Friend of Allah. He sold his ship and performed the pilgrimage with us along with his sons, and established a zawiya in Upper Egypt. 
               Many miracles were granted to him, and this journey itself was one of them. May Allah have mercy on him, and be well pleased with him."

              <h2> Benefits of Hizb Al Bahr</h2>
              <hr>
              <h3>Shaykh Nuh Keller says of the litany:
                  "Hizb al-Bahr or 'The Litany of the Sea' is recited after the midafternoon prayer ('asr). Some read it at sunrise, at which time it possesses particular benefits, and it is also read whenever one is in particular need of something,
                   in which case one makes one's intention at the words wa sakhkhir lana hadha l-bahr ("and subject to us this sea"). There is safety where it is recited. Like all of the hizbs of the tariqa, it should be memorized and recited from one's heart as if it were one's own words,
                  with complete attention to whom one is addressing it. It is not a magic wand, but an expres-sion of slavehood and poverty. In a general way, the purpose of these wirds is not only to train the heart in du'a but to eventually eliminate one's absentmindedness from Allah, 
                  and one must strive in them to have presence of heart. Though memorized, they are not rote." ( Sea Without Shore, pp.176)
                  
                    <br><br>
                  Moroccan Shaykh and Sufi master, Sidi Ahmad Zarruq says: 
                  "Invoke the Litany of the Sea and it will show you wonders, give you ease in your affairs, 
                  and lend you strength. You will find the sea obedient and the wind submissive; 
                  You will find gentleness quickly, and your time will be joyful."
                  
                  He also states:
                  "As for how to use the Litany, it differs according to intention and spiritual aspiration. 
                  It is used for the purpose of bringing benefit and warding off harm, and the specific intention 
                  should be made at the words and subject to us this sea. This is what Ibn ‘Abbad (may Allah have mercy 
                  on him) said, as I have seen in his own handwriting, and it is correct. Ibn Ata’Allah said in Lata’if al-Minan, 
                  ‘It is a wird for after the afternoon [‘asr] prayer, while the Great Litany is for after the dawn prayer.’ I might add to this that the Munajat 
                  [concluding prayers] of the Hikam of Ibn Ata’Allah should be read in the final part of the night before dawn. Each of them has its own secret, 
                  as the one who sticks to them will discover in no short time if he holds to piety and righteousness without taking on too much; and Allah knows best"
